This data has been extracted from various sources to facilitate compartmental modeling efforts. The dataset is designed for simplicity of access. 

## The Setup

The main flatfile is kept in a large OpenOffice Spreadsheet. The summary and Sierra Leone country file are extracted with R. For sample R code to select a given region see the doSummary file.

## Disclaimer

Obvious errors are obvious. This data is prone to off-by-one errors on the date, because results for a given day are often from the day before. Data gleaned from the preliminary NEJM article were literally picked from charts.
